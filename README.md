### INTRODUCTION

Identifying fake news is a crucial step towards preserving the virtue and prosperity of society. Social mediaâ€™s rising
popularity has led to an increase in the spread of false information. News Content is the only reason for the present fake news detection algorithms. The proposed research seeks to investigate several machine learning approaches for the analysis and identification of false news. In order to identify the spread of fake news on social media, we use various widely used machine learning methods, such as Logestic Regression. we develop a number of machine learning methods using the WELFake dataset.
